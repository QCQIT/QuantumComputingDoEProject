===== Tentative agenda =====


A tentative agenda for the meeting is

o overview of budget and students
o what we have done till now (short reports by each work package and present students)
o recruiting of students
o new plans/proposals and existing proposals we are involved in
o website or similar things for the project.
o other topics and feel free to propose other topics

===== Overview of budget and students =====


Sue Hopper made projection for our DOE grant. The projection shows an
approximate overdraft amount of 21kUSD at the end of Summer 2022 and is
based on the following:
 
!bblock  Students
o Joseph Bonitati: 100% Fall 2021 through Summer 2022
o Nicholas Cariello: 100% Summer 2021 through Summer 2022
o Gabriel Given: 53% Spring 2021 and 67% Summer 2021
o Ben Hall: 100% through Summer 2022
o Caleb Hicks: 53% Spring 2021 and 67% Summer 2021
o Danny Jammoa: 100% Fall 2021 through Summer 2022
o Giovanni Pederiva: 100% through Summer 2022
o Avik Sarkar: 53% Spring 2021 and 67% Summer 2021
